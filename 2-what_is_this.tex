        \item{w3schools: ``In JavaScript, the thing called \texttt{this}, is the
              object that `owns' the current code.''}
        \item{\texttt{this} is a keyword which evaluates to the current
              \textit{invocation context}, and how it is set depends upon how
              the current function was invoked.}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item{\textbf{Method Invocation:} If the current fuction was invoked as
              a method, then \texttt{this} is the \textit{receiver object}.}
        \item{\textbf{Constructor Invocation:} If the current function was
              invoked as a constructor (i.e. using the \texttt{new} keyword),
              then \texttt{this} is the new object being constructed.}
        \item{\textbf{Explicit Argument:} If the current function was called via
              its \texttt{call()} or \texttt{apply()} methods, then
              \texttt{this} will be the first argument passed in.}
        \item{\textbf{Otherwise:} If in the root of the script or in a normal
              function invocation, \texttt{this} is the global object.}
